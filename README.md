# EDDy

![Figure showing an example of a level and the different components and patterns use in EDDy](map-figure.png)

This is EDDy, the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer. Treat it well, and it will
prove to be a good friend.

## How to use

**Clone the repo and import it as a Maven project!!** All dependencies are included in the [pom.xml](pom.xml), so everything should work
out of the box then. 

### Prerequisites

EDDy uses [JavaFX v.17.0.2](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/); thus, Java JDK 17 (v.17) is needed! 

JavaFX is added as a dependency in the [pom.xml](pom.xml) so there is no need to manually download JavaFX!
