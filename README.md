# Eddy

![Figure showing an example of a level and the different components and patterns use in EDDy](map-figure.png)

This is Eddy, the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer. Treat it well, and it will
prove to be a good friend.

## How to use

**Clone the repo and import it as a Maven project**. Everything should work
out of the box then. It is also possible to build a stand-alone executable JAR
file by running the following:

```
mvn clean install package
```

### Prerequisites

Eddy runs on Java SE 8u40 or newer, and uses JavaFX.
