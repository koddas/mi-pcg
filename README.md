# Eddy

This is Eddy, the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer. Treat him well, and he'll
prove to be a good friend.

## How to use

Just clone the repo and import it as a Maven project. Everything should work
out of the box then. It is also possible to build a stand-alone executable JAR
file by running the following:

```
mvn clean install package
```

## Prerequisites

Eddy runs on Java SE 8u40 or newer.
